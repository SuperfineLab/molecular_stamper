# post setup v2

## description

Fixed to an optical breadboard. X, Y, and Z translation stages are at the bottom of the setup, an optical post and precision mount are fixed on top of the stages, and a clamp and 1/4" optical post extend horizontally from the top of the setup for the stamper to hang on. When the stamper is lowered in Z and the bottom rests on the target slide, the 1/4" post is no longer holding the hanger so it is effectively disengaged. 

## future improvements

Replace the 1/4" post with extended 3D printed stamper that can screw into clamp, for stability.
